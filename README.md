This is a website I made with some games, a NAS, a 'proxy', and a terminal to whatever computer is running it.<br><br>
The code here isn't really adapted for general use, so if you'd like to use it, you may need to rework some code to work with whatever directory structure you configure.<br>
You'll also need to create new passwords using 'hash.py'<br>
