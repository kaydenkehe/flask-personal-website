# PersonalWebsite
This is a website I made with some games, a NAS, a 'proxy', and a terminal to whatever computer is running it.<br><br>
The code here isn't really adapted for general use, so if you'd like to use it, you may need to rework some code to work with whatever directory structure you configure.<br>
You'll also need to create new passwords using 'hash.py'<br><br>
I also removed all the games included in the YouTube video from this repo, as to not steal their work! If you'd like to create or add games, you can put their HTML files in the 'game_pages' directory. :)
